Scripts for running the simulations done in the evaluation of censcyt.

The package censcyt needs to be installed, which can be done by running in R:

```R
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("retogerber/censcyt")
```


For running with the real data, first download the .fcs files from https://flowrepository.org/id/FR-FCM-ZZ99 and copy them to a newly created directory in [Data/Real](Data/Real) called Raw .
